# Professional README Generator
  
## Project Description
As a student developer, writing quality README files has been a challenge.  So I wrote a node.js app to help me stay focused and actually produce a README.md file for my projects so that I don't fail my bootcamp course.  The app uses inquirer 8.2.4 to generate prompts to aid in the files completion.  Based on user input, the app  dynamically generates a  README.md file  with a table of contents,  section headings , license inforation and contact links.
 

## Installation
This app requires Node.js and Inquirer 8.2.4

## Usage
This is a CLI application
